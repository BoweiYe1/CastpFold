<h2>CASTpFold Update</h2>

<ul>
    <!-- <li><strong>Pockets and cavities in DNAs and RNAs can be calculated now!</strong></li> -->
    <!--
    <li>More details of the pocket measurement are provided.
        <strong> You can find how each residue contributes to the surface area of pockets.</strong></li>
    -->
    <li><strong>The database is enlarged, now containing both PDB and AlphaFold2 predicted structures.</strong>
        <br>
        All 'non-fragment' sequences in Uniprot have representative AF2 structures, totaling 30 million.</li>
    <br>

    <li><strong>Similar pockets are now provided for surface and protein-protein interacting pockets.</strong>
        <br>
        The surface pocket database has 4.1 million members, and the protein-protein interaction (ppi) pocket database contains 500 thousand.</li>
    <br>

    <li><strong>Predicted functional pockets and residues are provided for AF2 structures.</strong>
        <br>
        The corresponding Gene Ontology (GO) terms/Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers will be provided.</li>
    <br>
</ul>
    


<h2>Webpage Update</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Changing the view in the molecular viewer is now more intuitive.</li>

    <br>
    <li>We remade the UI of the CASTp server website. 
    <br>   Now you can find more helpful information via the website.
    </li>

    <!-- <li><strong>We rewrote the backend software so that the computations now are 2-5 times faster.</strong></li> -->
    <br>
    <li>We fixed the bug that made the CASTp server website not compatible with the Safari browser.</li>
    <br>
    <li>We fixed the issues that caused the CASTp server sometimes to not be displayed properly on mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
